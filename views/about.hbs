                BRAT Vapor is owned by theBRATcrew, LLC which is owned by Jackie and Richard Berka. Family owned and
                operated, the BRAT
                Vapor brand was founded in 2015. Since then the name has been growing by leaps and bounds, and is
                quickly
                becoming one
                of the top names.<br/><br/> Plans have already been set into motion to open up the first ever BRAT
                Wholesale
                Warehouse. When everything is complete
                you will be able to find top-notch vaping products at hard-to-beat prices.<br/><br/> BRAT Juice is a
                smooth
                80/20 blend of juice, with flavors that are so amazing you won't be able to get enough of them.
                BRAT Vapor juice is prepared in a state of the art ISO certified facility and steeped to perfection.
                With
                BRAT juice you
                never have to worry about what types of extra additives are in the mix because there are none, just the
                way
                it should be.
                Our sweet flavors are sweet due to the mixtures of our recipes, not because we add stuff to make it that
                way.<br/><br/>
